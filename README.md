The Superstore dataset is a collection of transactional sales data from a retail business. It provides insights into various aspects of the store's operations, including sales, profit, discounts, customer segments, and shipping details. The dataset includes information on different product categories, sub-categories, and regional sales performance, making it a valuable resource for analyzing business trends, identifying high-performing products, and optimizing sales strategies.

By examining this dataset, businesses can gain actionable insights into customer purchasing patterns, profitability trends, and the impact of discounts on revenue, ultimately helping in data-driven decision-making.

This dataset was gotten from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bravehart101/sample-supermarket-dataset) and the analysis was carried out using Power BI.
The dataset contains 9,994 records and 13 columns. It represents a Superstore's sales data, covering various aspects such as ship mode, segment, location, category, sales, quantity, discount, and profit.
No missing values were detected in the dataset. Duplicates were found and removed. Wrong data type was checked and corrected.


# Summary and recommedations from the Analysis


1. Category & Subcategory Performance: Technology and Office Supplies generate consistent profit. Furniture has high sales but lower profitability, possibly due to higher costs or discounts.
Focus on Technology & Office Supplies as they are consistently profitable.

2. Impact of Discounts on Profitability: Higher discounts tend to reduce profitability, especially in Furniture and high-discount transactions. 
Striking a balance between discounts and profit margins is crucial.

3. Ship Mode Optimization: Leverage the high volume of Standard Class shipments and explore opportunities for Same Day shipping to cater to premium customers.
